### Hello, Abhinav_dubey here! ðŸ‘‹
âš¡ Fun fact: "Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician, is often credited as the world's first programmer. In the mid-1800s, she wrote the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, specifically Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Lovelace's visionary ideas about the potential of computers went far beyond their initial use for calculations, making her a trailblazer (margdarshak) in the field of computer science."
Have a good day visitor!
